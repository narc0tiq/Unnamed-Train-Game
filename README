So far, so good!

  Please don't clone this repository. It's suffering from a bad case of the 
"holy shit, why did we commit THAT?!?" -- specifically with regards to some 
enormous blobs (binary large objects), i.e. completely obscure files that
shouldn't have gone into revision control in the first place.

When we get back to actively working on this project, the first thing will 
be to rewrite the repository history to remove all history of those 
horrible, horrible things.

...or maybe it'll be a new project altogether, I dunno.
